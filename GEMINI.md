# Project Overview

This project is a single-page, static website for "EventsHandlerz," an event planning service. It's built with fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design is elegant and classical, with a focus on a clean user experience.

## Main Technologies

*   **HTML:** Provides the structure for the web page.
*   **CSS:** Styles the page for a clean and responsive layout. It features a classical aesthetic with custom fonts.
*   **JavaScript:** Used for a single feature: smooth scrolling navigation between sections of the page.

## Architecture

The project consists of three main files:

*   `index.html`: The main entry point and content of the website.
*   `styles.css`: Contains all the styling for the website.
*   `script.js`: Implements the smooth scrolling for anchor links.

The website is a single-page layout with a sticky navigation bar.

# Building and Running

This is a static website and doesn't require a build process or a special server. To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

The code is well-structured and easy to read.

*   **HTML:** Uses semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
*   **CSS:** Uses CSS variables for color management and a consistent design. It also includes a media query for basic responsiveness on smaller screens.
*   **JavaScript:** The code is simple, well-commented, and uses modern JavaScript features like `const` and arrow functions.
